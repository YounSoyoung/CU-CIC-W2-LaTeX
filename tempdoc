FLoC is the abbreviation ‘Federated Learning of Cohorts’ This tech Instead of exposing details of individual users to advertisers, multiple users of similar interests are grouped into groups such as soccer fans, truck drivers, retired travelers, and others. Formerly, this kind of Google ads tech using cookies for user custom ads. Cookies divide two types First-party and Third-party. The first-party cookie published a user-visited website. The first-party cookie mostly uses for fast log-in. The problem is third-party cookies.
Google noticed end of third-party cookies. Cookies are small text files carry like Site usage details and Login History. Digital advertising companies use cookies for custom ads that are called a third-party cookie. Google acknowledges replacing from (only third-party) cookies to FLoC. These Google’s announcement is contradictory. Cause FLoC also has critical issues. Third-party Cookies save their own user's computers and send to ads companies for custom ads. Third-party cookies can include user’s privacy information. It means personal information can leakage. It is being an issue. Google’s assertation FLoC can remove these leakage issues. However, FLoC has similar issues. FLoC designates personal Cohort ID and groups users to share custom ads. These being issues. Cohort ID makes it easier to track a specific user.

Problem and concern of FLoC
Nowadays, there is a lot of criticism about the FLoC. There are three main reasons for this: First, the FLoC has not achieved its most important goal of preventing invasion of privacy. This technology has not solved the fundamental problem of targeted advertising. Also, it has a narrow scope and only Google Chrome gets benefits.
Google claims to assign thousands of users to cohort IDs to prevent individual users from being tracked, but even in this case, it provides a significant element in configuring fingerprinting. Google used 8-bit cohort IDs in its proof of concept, and it is anticipated to be more than 16 bits after they are introduced. The problem is that the higher the number of cohorts, the more distinct the characteristics of a particular cohort, and the longer the identity of a cohort group, the more specific the advertiser can take about the user. In addition, although the cohort ID does not work as an identifier, an operator that has already identified a particular user can obtain additional user browsing data once a week via the cohort ID. As they pile up in the long run, they can be weapons that allow users to know exactly what changes their behaviour patterns are. In particular, site operators who know information such as users' email addresses can add new privacy items by incorporating information acquired through FLoC into users' profiles. 
Next, there is a problem with the targeted advertising itself. Target advertising is a business way in which advertisers reach certain people in a way that excludes some people. In this way, some may experience discrimination, such as not being able to access job openings and others not being offered better loan terms. Since the FLoC will form a group using an "unsupervised algorithm", it is impossible to completely prevent people from becoming part of a group that reflects an individual's sensitive characteristics. Google said it would monitor the results of the system to see if there is any association with sensitive categories, but it is not clear how long it will take to resolve them as something that has been done before. 
Since FLoC only applies to Chrome browser, it still leaves privacy breaches and user tracking problems in cross-browser, cross-device, and offline data. In addition, there is a controversy that Google is a monopoly of the market in that it is both the operator of Chrome and the largest provider of targeted advertising. Moreover, advertising companies are reluctant to FLoC because detailed targeting is not possible and standard marketing techniques are not available. Examples are techniques that control the type of advertisement and the number of exposures, which are important because they have a great connection with the effect of advertising.
